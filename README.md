**Carlos** is currently an Assistant Professor at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K.
He is the Head of the [Robot Motor Intelligence (RoMI) Lab](https://www.romilab.org) affiliated with the National Robotarium and Edinburgh Centre for Robotics.
He is also appointed as Research Scientist at IHMC, USA.

The central topic of Carlosâ€™ research career is how to build general motor intelligence that enables athletic behaviours, dexterous manipulation and sensory-driven motor control.
To build such capabilities, his research focuses on both top-down (principles, abstractions) and bottom-down (stimuli, data) approaches.
